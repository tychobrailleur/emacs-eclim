=== New features

 * added eclim-run-configuartion which runs a run configuration in the

   for the symbol at point.
 * added eclim-java-generate-setter which generates a setter method
   for the symbol at point.
 * added eclim-java-refactor-move-class which allows moving a top level
   class or interface from one package to another.
 * added eclim-project-setting-set which can assign an Eclim project
   setting.
 * Fixed some compiler warnings. Not all compiler warnings were fixed
   since those changes could not be tested.
 * Enable automatic starting of eclimd with eclimd-autostart: This starts eclimd
   from within Emacs whenever eclim-mode is enabled or global-eclim-mode
   requires eclimd to determine if eclim-mode should be enabled in a
   buffer. This is opt-in for now, but may be the default in a future release.
   eclimd-autostart-with-default-workspace controls whether eclimd asks for a
   workspace when it gets autostarted (default nil).
